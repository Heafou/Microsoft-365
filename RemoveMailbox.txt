If you work in a hybrid environment with an onPremise Exchange and an Exchange Online, you maid experience a surprise if you add an Office 365 licence with an Exchange Online plan to a user that is suppose to stay onPremise or before you create the mailbox onPremise and migrate it. 
Indeed, once you add the licence, it automaticaly create an online UserMailbox if there is not. This is when the tricky part starts. It may be the first time you use a hybrid environment, a user that had no mailbox until here or just a forgot while creating fast multiple user, howerver once you are there, you are in trouble...  Online mailbox cannot simply be deleted without touching Online User and without repercussion on onPremise user account. Deleting the user Online will also delete the user onPrem and there is no powershell cmdlet to delete only the mailbox when you are running a hybrid environment. If the user has also access to Sharepoint, Dynamics, etc... you definitly don't want to delete the user as you'll not be able to restore their previous access because his objectID will be different.
This is why I wrote this script that will permanently delete the mailboxes for the users specifyed in a txt file removing the Exchange Online plan et deleting all the exchange informations store in the user account without having trouble . 
This script offer you an easy and automate way to do it for multiple user. Once you are done with it, you can create the onpremise mailbox, migrate it online then reenable the Exchange Online plan if needed.
